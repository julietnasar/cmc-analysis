## Contraceptive Method Choice Analysis

This project will be analyzing the contraceptive method choice dataset which is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. 
“The samples are married women who were either not pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview” (archive.ics.uci.edu)

## Method
Using different models we will predict whether a person will use: no contraceptives, short-term contraceptives, or long-term contraceptives.
